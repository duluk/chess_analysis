Nf3 d5 {I wasn't really ready for this move. c6 was one thing, but then this. I didn't know what to do so I both attacked and defended with c3.} 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bg4 5. h3 Bxf3 6. gxf3 $2 {xf3 was better here. I just reacted when taking with the g pawn. That just doubled my pawns though, instead of getting the queen out and in the action of the quick-paced opening.} e5 7. Bc4 {I'm really just sort of following more Italian opening ideas. Not the best move here.} Nh6 {[%cal Rc1h6,Gd2d3]} 8. d3 {Opens up the diaganol to h6 and defends the center bishop and knight.} f5 9. Ng5 {This may not have been the best/right move. My idea was to then maybe play e6, forking the queen and the bishop. Black wasn't going to allow that though.} Qd6 10. f4 $1 {Fine This was a Fritz hint, ngl. Pawn moves like this aren't clear to me.} g6 11. O-O Na6 12. fxe5 Qd7 13. Qe2 {I think Fritz's hint was "move the queen to a light-colored square". That was either e2 or f3. e2 seemed ok, even though it should block the file for the rook on f1. But I figured having a rook behind a queen was fine.} b5 14. Bf7+ $1 {Decoy So Fritz was suggesting to evade the attack. Maybe b3 was better, but I can't resist attacks/checks like this. I knew I was guarded by the knight on g5; however, I missed black's knight on h6. This was the beginning of black's turnaround, winning most of the rest of the game.} Nxf7 15. Nxf7 $4 {As said in the previous comment, I didn't see xf7. I knew this knight was protecting the bishop so I instinctively played it. It may have been this move that I blundered. The machine seems to have liked f7. But this move was when black was suddenly better. But dang there was a fork of the knight and queen that I totally missed.} (15. e6 {[%cal Re6f7,Re6d7,Re2e8,Yg5f7] I completely missed this move. If the queen takes, I take back with the knight. If the knight takes my knight, I take the queen. If the queen moves anywhere else, I take the knight while checking the king, being protected by my knight AND a discovered attack/check on thje king by the queen. Dual check. What a miss.  The best move for black is probably e7, putting herself between the king and my queen.} Qc7 $4 (15... Qe7 $1 {[%cal Re6f7,Rg5f7,Ye7f7] Actually, taking with the pawn at this point may not be the best. It opens the file for an attack on my queen. So black can ignore it, lose the knight and take my queen, who is hanging. Taking with the knight can win a rook if missed by black. (g8 is best move)} 16. Nxf7 {[%cal Rf7h8,Ye6f7,Re7f7,Gh8g8]} Rg8 17. Bg5 {[%cal Rg5e7,Yf7g5,Ye6f7]} Qc7) 16. exf7+ $1 Kd8 17. Qe8# $1) 15... Kxf7 {[%cal Re6f7,Re6d7,Ge5e6]} 16. b4 $6 {[%cal Ge5e6,Re6f7,Re6d7] I don't know what Fritz's hint was, but it looks like I missed another fork! This time between the king and queen, the putative royal fork. That may not have been the best move; Fritz is suggesting a3, a4, b3, c3, c4. Literally every pawn move on the queen side except the one I played. smh} Bxb4 17. d4 Qd5 18. Rb1 {At this point in the game I was trying to follow Fritz's hints pretty closely. I would not have gotten back in the game if on my own.} Rae8 19. Be3 {[%cal Ye3d4]} Rc8 20. a4 h6 21. axb5 cxb5 22. Rfd1 {[%cal Yd1d4,Ye3d4,Rb1b4]} h5 23. Ra1 {[%cal Ra1a6,Yd1d4]} Rc6 {[%cal Yc6a6]} 24. Qd3 Rhc8 25. Qb3 {[%cal Rb3d5,Rd5b3]} Rd8 {[%cal Yd8d5] It's an interesting move. Instead of making the exchange, Fritz defends the queen. It does take it away from doubling up on the c-file.} 26. Bg5 {I wasn't being as smart as I thought. I figured I was going to push the rook away from the queen and then I could take black's queen. Of course it didn't occur to me that black could play the obvious d7 or d6. Duh.} Rd7 27. Qxd5+ {So I took anyway.} Rxd5 28. c3 Bxc3 29. Rdc1 Rxd4 30. Rxc3 Rxc3 31. Rxa6 Ra4 32. e6+ Kg7 {[%cal Ga6d6,Gd6d7,Rd7g7]} 33. Rd6 Rc8 34. Rd7+ Kg8 35. Bf6 Ra3 36. Rg7+ Kf8 37. Rh7 {[%cal Ye6d7,Yf6e7,Ye6f7,Yf6g7,Yh7c7]} Rg3+ 38. Kh2 $1 {Sharp} Rxh3+ 39. Kxh3 Rc3+ 40. Kg2 $1 {Adventurous} Ke8 41. Rh8# {Very well played by White.} 1-0
